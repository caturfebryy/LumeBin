mqsvc.exe is a legitimate executable file associated with Microsoft Windows, specifically related to the Message Queuing (MSMQ) service, which facilitates communication between applications on different computers. This file, with a version number of 5.1.0.1110, is published by Microsoft and is generally considered safe, as it is part of the Windows operating system. However, like many system files, it can be targeted by malware, and users may encounter errors if the file becomes corrupted or if there are issues with the MSMQ service itself.

It is important for users to ensure that mqsvc.exe is located in the correct directory and to perform regular antivirus scans to confirm that the file has not been compromised.
