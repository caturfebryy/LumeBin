Users may encounter errors related to msiexec.exe, such as installation failures or issues with software updates, which can often be resolved by checking for corrupted files, ensuring that the Windows Installer service is running, or repairing the installation of the affected software. Overall, while msiexec.exe is an integral and safe component of the Windows operating system, vigilance is advised to prevent potential security risks.
